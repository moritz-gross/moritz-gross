# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in programming, math and AI.

## some of my favourite (public) projects

### Fixcon

For a big part of my Bachelor studies, I worked part-time as a research engineer for the Algorithms research group of my university.

I implemented a [solver](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb12/research-groups/algorith/software/fixcon) for a graph problem based on [this](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb12/arbeitsgruppen/algorith/paper/alenex20-fixcon.pdf) paper.
