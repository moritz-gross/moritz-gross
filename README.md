- currently I'm pursuing a Masters degree in Data Science.
- some of my open-source contributions:
  - various works on [MathCAT](https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCAT)
    - _MathCAT_ is used in many accessibility tools to let blind people work with mathematics
  - implementation of the [Powersort](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29208) algorithm in _Numpy_
    - an adaptive sorting algorithm designed to optimally exploit existing order in the input data with minimal overhead
  - some small patches: [spin]( https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/issues/268), [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6277), [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6680)
