- I'm pursuing a Masters degree in Data Science.
- Sometimes, I contribute to open source projects I'm using:
  - This includes small patches like in [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6680), [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6277) & [spin]( https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/issues/268) 
  - And bigger ones like [sorting in NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29208)
