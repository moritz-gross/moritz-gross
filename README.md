Hi there ðŸ‘‹. 

I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science, focusing on AI, algorithms, complexity, and their intersection.
I'm also working for [Math4VIP](www.math4vip.org), a university project focused on making STEM accessible to blind people.

My personal website [can be found here]([https://github.com/dienerlab](https://moritz-gross.github.io/)).
